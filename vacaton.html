<h1>Summer Vacation</h1>
<P><IMG SRC="scenery.jfif"
ALT="scenery">
I just have happily completed my summer vacation this year. I was very happy and enjoyed it a lot by forgetting all the pressure of school days. My parents kept this plan hidden from me to give me a surprise. And I was really surprised when I heard about the plan for my summer vacation. It was a long tour of all India’s cultural heritages and beautiful tourist places.I have captured all the memorable moments on my smartphone to keep them with me forever. My sweet family members are also captured in the clicks. We went swimming, morning walk in the cool natural air, wandered on the roads full of greenery, played football on the ground, and did many joyful activities in between the tour whenever we got time. I have noticed and tried to learn something good from the people of all cultures and traditions of India. I was excited to join the cricket academy from the end; however, when I heard about the plan from my parents, I shouted, jumped many times, and forgot about cricket.I am very happy because my inner soul is satisfied. During the tour, I have also done a lot of shopping with my parents at various places in India. I think it was the best summer vacation of my life. Now, we are back at home and started doing my project work. I have to help my sister and brother complete their holiday homework. Two weeks are left more in opening our school. After completing our school holiday homework, we will go to the home town to meet our grandparents. We can go there by bus because it is quite a short way of 200 km. Later, we will go on a short tour of Pradarshani and nearby historical places of the village. We will eat lots of mangoes, bael, papaya, litchi, banana, cucumber, and kakadi, including other summer fruits and homemade ice cream, at my grandparent’s home.There is also a lake where migratory birds come every year. We will enjoy seeing them in the early morning and evening. This summer vacation is full of huge fun for me, but I have to take care of my health too so that I cannot fall sick and join my school properly.</p>
